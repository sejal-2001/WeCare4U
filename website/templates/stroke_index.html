				<h3>Stroke</h3>
				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>A stroke occurs when the flow of blood to a certain part of the brain is disrupted or diminished, leading to a deprivation of oxygen and essential nutrients to the brain tissue.

				This interruption results in the rapid death of brain cells within a matter of minutes. Timely and immediate medical intervention is of utmost importance since a stroke is considered a medical emergency.

				</p>
				<p>Taking early action can significantly minimize brain damage and potential complications. Fortunately, the number of stroke-related fatalities in the United States has significantly decreased over time. 
				The availability of effective treatments has also contributed to preventing disabilities resulting from strokes.</p>
